# Dao-JDBC

This project was developed as part of my studies in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), with focus on implementing the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.
It demonstrates a complete CRUD implementation using Java and MySQL, emphasizing clear separation of responsibilities between layers and proper database abstraction.

## Project Goals

- Practice JDBC database connection
- Implement full CRUD operations using DAO pattern
- Separate business logic from data access logic
- Apply layered architecture (Repository + Service)
- Use PreparedStatement safely
- Handle SQL exceptions properly
- Apply clean architecture principles
- Improve code organization and maintainability

## Technologies Used

- Java 25
- JDBC
- MySQL
- Git & GitHub

## Features

- Insert new records
- Update existing records
- Delete records
- Find by ID
- List all records

## How to Run

1. Create a MySQL database as in 'Database'
2. Copy 'db.properties.example' to 'db.properties' and configure your credentials.
3. Run the application

## Concepts Practiced

- JDBC API
- DAO pattern
- SQL integration
- Layered architecture
- Exception handling
- Clean code practices
- Object mapping (ResultSet → Entity)
